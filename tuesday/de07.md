**On Prem** - _Pacific Approach_

- Peaceful, restful, approach
- things that are fairly static, or change less often

**Cloud-hosted** - _Atlantic Approach_

- rapidly changing things
- busy things

Astute Knowledge (knowledge management) - _something to look up_

Booker and Suiter - helps integrate chat and telephony so that if someone is on a call they don't get assigned chats and vice versa

Azure Service Bus - connecting to other systems in/out of the organization
Azure Function (webhook receiver)

Avoid plugins.
