Connector is a wrapper around an API that allows underlying service to talk to Flow and PowerApps

APIM Gateway (between Flow/PowerApps and our APIs)

Open API (Swagger) Specification Microsoft Extensions **- be aware**

API Keys as required + internal parameters with a default value. Doesn't expose key to user, but also allows them to connect without needing to know the API Key. (Set auth to none)

CRM Rest Builder (useful tool for developing connectors)

Application user doesn't eat a license and you can have many so that you can control permissions fairly granularly.
