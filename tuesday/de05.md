**6 Factors when considering omnichannel**
- channels and personalized experience
- 360 degree view
- mobile integration
- BOT integration
  - bot as agent
  - bot as enabler
- agent productivity
- content engagement

**Live Assist**
- live chat
- co-browse
- bot
- voice (escalation)
- video (escalation)

Bots/Chat have the ability to create cases, leads, etc from their interactions

Bots allow reaching more customers with personalized help, without raising staffing

Co-Browse snippet can be added to not CRM/portal properties [myWellmark, BlueSource, etc]

**Bot as an Agent**
- bot uses live assist to answer what it can
- if it gets stumped it can transfer to an agent
  - can use skills based routing 
- Supervisors can monitor bot and intercede when required, even ***whispering*** to a bot (also allows coaching of real agents)
- Agents can transfer easy tasks TO bots, password reset for example

**Bot as an Enabler**
- Best use case is when you're creating bots in other chat systems [fb messeger, etc]


Canned responses in chat, for agents, allow speeding up of standard responses like "/c hello" = "Hello, how many I assist you today?"

Co Browse - agent can highlight where to click, can draw on screen, and other things to help convey expected usage to customer.
